Boris Bikes

This was my first Github project so I decided to replicate a fantastically simple JS app that displays bikes and spaces for each Boris Bike station in London from Suze Shardlow.
Instead of JS, I used Python and in particular the Bokeh library to display the information. I couldn't find a sufficient Geolocator so the map doesn't centre on your location or display a red one-mile radius circle.
The link to Suze's simple and far superior project is: https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/boris_bikes.

Replace GOOGLE_API_KEY in main.py with a Maps JavaScript API from Google's API and run main.py to load the app locally.
